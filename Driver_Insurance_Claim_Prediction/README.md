# Predict Drivers' Insurance Claim

## The goal of this project:
Build a model to try to predict whether a driver will file a claim in the next year for Porto Seguro to better tailor their prices and make insurance more accessible for more drivers.

The target feature is binary, 0 is the driver will not file a claim on next year, while 1 is the driver will file a claim on next year.

1. train.csv contains the training data, where each row corresponds to a policyholder, and the target columns signify that a claim was filed.
2. test.csv contains the test data.
